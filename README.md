## <a name="providerpattern">Provider Pattern</a>

As you probably already know, React uses a unilateral data (props) flow from parent components to children's ones. This is called _prop drilling_. This can quickly become an issue when we pass down props to components located deep in the tree and unrelated components share this data along the way.
Let's imagine we have an `App` component that fetches data items. Lower on the tree, we have a `Card`, `List` and finally `ListItem` components.

Then we would need to pass down data items, useful only to `ListItem`, to multiple layers that don't need them. The bigger the application, the harder it can become to maintain and refactor.  
The **Provider Pattern** solves this problem by enabling us to store data in a globalized state, _React Context_, and directly share it to a selected component.

**Let's do a real code example.**

First, let's define a react context, this will serve us to save our global data.

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';

export const Context = React.createContext(null);
```

Then, let's create a button that will use a `themeColor` to define which color to use. By using the `useContext` hook, we can directly access any data saved in our react context.

```jsx
import { Context } from '../../context/index';

const ThemedButton = ({ children }) => {
  const contextValue = React.useContext(Context);

  return (
    <Button
      themeColor={contextValue.themeColor}
      onClick={contextValue.updateThemeColor}
    >
      {children}
    </Button>
  );
};

export default ThemedButton;
```

Now, we can use our `Context` and `ThemedButton`. The react provider uses a `value` prop, which is the data that we want to pass down.

```jsx
import ThemedButton from './ThemedButton';
import { Context } from '../../context';

const THEME_COLOR = `primary`;

const Usage = () => {
  const [themeColor, setThemeColor] = React.useState(THEME_COLOR);

  const updateThemeColor = () => {
    setThemeColor(themeColor === `primary` ? `secondary` : `primary`);
  };

  return (
    <Context.Provider value={{ themeColor, updateThemeColor }}>
      <Card>
        <List>
          <ThemedButton>Btn</ThemedButton>
        </List>
      </Card>
    </Context.Provider>
  );
};
```

We don't need anymore to manually pass down props through each layer.  
Some of the most common use cases for the provider pattern are theming, i18n, authentication and logging.

## <a name="compoundpattern">Compound Coponents Pattern</a>

This one is my favourite pattern. Very often, you do write interdependent components that share states and handler logic. The compound component pattern helps you to create a group of components that all work together. It allows you to build more customizable components, with a flexible API.
Compound components manage their own internal state, which they share among the several child components. To share state, you have 2 ways. One with _React.cloneElement_ and the other with _React Context_.

**Example: Counter component**

> All the source code is accessible on:
> https://github.com/emuraton/react-patterns/tree/main/src/patterns/compound-components

```jsx
const MIN_VALUE = 0;
const MAX_VALUE = 20;

const Counter = ({ children }) => {
  const [quantity, setQuantity] = React.useState(0);

  const onIncrement = () => {
    if (quantity === MAX_VALUE) return;
    setQuantity(quantity + 1);
  };
  const onDecrement = () => {
    if (quantity === MIN_VALUE) return;
    setQuantity(quantity - 1);
  };

  // You can replace React.cloneElement by React Context if you fancy
  return (
    <Container>
      {React.Children.map(children, (child) =>
        React.cloneElement(child, { onIncrement, onDecrement, quantity })
      )}
    </Container>
  );
};
```

Then we can use it like this

```jsx
const Usage = () => {
  return (
    <Counter>
      <Counter.Decrement />
      <Counter.Quantity />
      <Counter.Increment />
    </Counter>
  );
};
```

This component has great UI flexibility, this is extremly powerful when you want to implement multiples variants of a component. For example, the user can change the SubComponentsâ€™ order or define which one should be displayed.
